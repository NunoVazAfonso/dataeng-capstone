### Data Model  
![Data Model](img/data_model.png "Data Model")  

#### Dimensions  
__Country__: geographical conformed dimension, with normalized iso information.  
_Source_: Flights and COVID datasets, Python library for enrichment and normalization  
__Airport__: airport dimension of different sizes, including regional and local airfields. Geographical information for country aggregation.  
_Source_: Flights dataset, airport-specific dataset  
__Airline__: airlines conformed dimension.  
_Source_: Flights dataset (derived from _callsign_)  
_TODO_: enrich with attributes such as name, geography or company size.  
__Country__:  Country conformed dimension, for geographical aggregation.  
_Source_: Flights dataset and country specific library.  
_TODO_: extend attributes, such as continent or other geopolitical, such as GDP  
__Date__: date conformed dimension   
_Source_: SQL generated  

#### Facts  
__Airport Arrivals__: number of flight arrivals per airport. Daily data per airport. Aggregation at country level via airport dimension.  
_Source_: Flights dataset  
__Airline Flights__: number of flights daily per airline. Aggregation per airline.  
_Source_: Flights dataset   
__Country COVID__: number of COVID cases, deaths and vaccinations, daily, per country  
_Source_: COVID and vaccination datasets  


### Project Scope and Challenges  

__Arrivals__(over Departures): Decision of analyzing Arrivals related to the approach of the subject from travelling as an economic activity that generates wealth primarily on arrival territory.  

__Country definition__: inconsistency of reference and codes between different data sources (iso2, iso3, country naming). Need for a single source of truth to connect and map same values. Provided by __PyCountry__ library.        

__Airport-level Granularity__: Greater precision, increased volume of data. Fact definition for flights at airport level allows for finer grain, while still allowing for country-level aggregation. Increased table cardinality.  
Decision of maintaining such granularity relates to the fact that this is a Big Data exercise.  

__Airlines Table__: Needs to be enriched, with further airline data, besides airline code. Decision of mainatining this fact and dimension tables relates to demonstration purposes of different approaches.  

__Defining the scope__: In itself a real challenge, with the diversity of data sets and the study of possibilities and approaches.
